# Employee-Performance-Analysis-Using-PySpark
## Project Summary
This project focuses on analyzing employee performance using PySpark, leveraging its capabilities for data processing, cleaning, and transformation. The objective is to create a structured data pipeline that ingests raw employee data, cleans it, and transforms it into a curated dataset for further analysis and reporting.
## Key Concepts:
### 1.	Data Ingestion:
  Initialize SparkSession to create a Spark application.
  Load sample employee data into a Spark DataFrame.
### 2.	Data Cleaning:
  Remove unnecessary columns and handle missing values.
  Standardize data formats and ensure data consistency.
### 3.	Silver Layer - Cleaned Data:
  Save the cleaned data to the Silver layer for intermediate storage.
  Use Delta Lake for versioning and efficient storage management.
### 4.	Transformations:
  Perform aggregations and computations to derive insights from the cleaned data.
  Examples include calculating average performance ratings, identifying high-performing departments, and tracking salary distributions.
### 5.	Gold Layer - Curated Data:
  Save the transformed data to the Gold layer for final analysis.
  Ensure the data is ready for business intelligence tools and reporting.
## Steps Involved:
### 1.	Setup and Sample Data Creation:
-	Create a SparkSession and define a schema for the employee data.
-	Load and display the sample data to understand its structure and content.
### 2.	Data Cleaning:
- Drop columns that are not relevant to the analysis.
- Handle missing or inconsistent data by filling or removing null values.
- Standardize data formats for consistency.
### 3.	Save Cleaned Data to Silver Layer:
- Save the cleaned DataFrame to the Silver layer using Delta Lake.
- Ensure the data is versioned and easily accessible for further transformations.
### 4.	Transform and Save Curated Data to Gold Layer:
- Calculate Average Performance Ratings: Aggregate the data to find the average performance rating for each department.
- Identify High-Performing Departments: Filter and rank departments based on their performance ratings.
- Track Salary Distributions: Analyze salary distributions across different departments and performance ratings.
- Save the curated data to the Gold layer, making it ready for final analysis.
## Benefits:
-	Scalability: PySpark handles large datasets efficiently, making it suitable for enterprise-level data processing.
-	Efficiency: Delta Lake optimizes storage and provides robust version control.
-	Flexibility: PySpark allows for complex data transformations and aggregations to derive meaningful insights.
- Integration: The curated data in the Gold layer can be seamlessly integrated with business intelligence tools for reporting and decision-making.

By following these steps and leveraging PySpark's powerful data processing capabilities, the project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to managing and analyzing employee performance data, ensuring high data quality and actionable insights.
